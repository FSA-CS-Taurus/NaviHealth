# NAVIHEALTH
NAVIHEALTH is an iOS based mobile app designed to help you track and meet your fitness goals while on the go. Along with a navigational map functionality, NAVIHEALTH stores the calories you can burn when you're trying to get from point A to point B and renders them onto beautiful charts to display daily, weekly, monthly progress.

NAVIHEALTH leverages Apple Maps, Google Places and Google Directions APIs to set up convenient routes for walking, biking and public transit. NAVIHEALTH utilizes Victory, a data visualization library to render out clean charts for users to keep track of calorie data across their routes. All data for users, maps, and calorie management / tracking is handled through Google Firebase.
